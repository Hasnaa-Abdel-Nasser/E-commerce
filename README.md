## About The Project
* The app allows users to browse through a wide range of products and brands, with categories and subcategories to make the search process easier.

* It includes a review system that enables users to leave feedback on products and brands, helping other buyers make informed decisions.

* The payment system is powered by Stripe, providing a secure and reliable payment gateway for users. Additionally, users can also opt for cash on delivery as a payment option.

* The app allows users to track their orders and receive updates on the status of their delivery. Once the order is confirmed, the app sends an email to the user with the details of the purchase and the total amount paid.
